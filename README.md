Arduino Micro Joystick Control - Designed for OSC Exhibits


Required Libraries
Adafruit_GFX

Adafruit_LEDBackpack

Creates a joystick control for 4 analog and 16 button inputs using an arduino
micro. Also has provisions for 7 Segment timer display and reset, along with
RF Remote Button control for system on/off. 

Place the hardware directory inside of your arduino program directory - this will overwrite two files needed to change the HID descriptor files and setup the proper variables. Make a backup of this drectory before you do this! - call it something like arduino-standard so you can rever easy.
